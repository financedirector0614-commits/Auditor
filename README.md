Regarding Threat Intelligence and Card Hiding in the Backend:
The HTML code above provides the front-end structure of the webpage. Threat intelligence and card hiding are backend functionalities and cannot be directly implemented within HTML.
Here's a conceptual overview of how these would typically be handled on the backend:
* Threat Intelligence: This involves using various data sources and techniques to identify and mitigate potential security threats. This would be implemented in your server-side code and infrastructure, including:
   * Monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns.
   * Using threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious IP addresses or activities.
   * Implementing security rules and firewalls to block malicious requests.
   * Regularly updating security patches and software.
* Card Hiding (Tokenization): For secure payment processing, you should never store raw credit card details directly in your database. Instead, you would use a process called tokenization:
   * When a user enters their credit card information, it is securely transmitted to a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Braintree).
   * The payment gateway replaces the sensitive card details with a unique, non-sensitive identifier called a "token."
   * Your backend stores this token instead of the actual card number.
   * When you need to process a payment, you send the token to the payment gateway, which then uses it to securely communicate with the card networks and banks.
To implement the secure payment functionality, you would need to:
* Choose a PCI DSS compliant payment gateway.
* Integrate the gateway's client-side JavaScript library into your webpage to securely collect payment information.
* Implement server-side code (using languages like Python, Node.js, PHP, etc.) to communicate with the payment gateway using their API to process payments using the tokens.
* Ensure your server and database are secure and follow best practices for web security.
This HTML structure provides a solid foundation for your "Leverage To Learn" webpage. Remember to implement the backend security measures appropriately when you integrate payment processing.
